# Interactive Map Applications Using Folium in Python

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to create interactive maps in Python using the **Folium** library. By using Lagos, Nigeria as an example, the project covers essential mapping functionalities, including:
- Adding markers, circles, polygons, and lines.
- Using GeoJSON data.
- Utilizing marker clusters for dense locations.
- Customizing map layers for different visual perspectives.

## Prerequisites
Install the required library:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Features

1. Basic Map: Displays a simple map centered on Lagos.
2. Markers: Highlights specific locations like landmarks.
3. Circles: Shows areas around specific points.
4. Polygons: Visualizes defined areas with multiple boundary points.
5. Lines: Represents routes or connections between locations.
6. GeoJSON Support: Displays data in GeoJSON format.
7. Marker Clustering: Groups nearby markers dynamically.
8. Custom Layers: Adds and toggles between multiple map styles.

## Running the Code
Each functionality is implemented in a separate script. Run any script using:

```bash
python <script_name>.py
```

The output map will automatically open in your default browser.
